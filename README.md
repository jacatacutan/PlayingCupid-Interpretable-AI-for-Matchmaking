This repository contains the primary notebook and final report (stylized as a journal paper) for the study titled "Playing Cupid: Improving Online Dating Matchmaking through Machine Learning Models." The study investigates the application of machine learning models to online dating by gaining insight from a speed dating dataset. Nuances of dating are further explored through Shapyley values (SHAP) and counterfactuals (DiCE).

## Abstract
This study delves into enhancing the matchmaking process in online dating platforms through machine learning models, with a focus on predicting successful first dates after matching. Recognizing the prevalent user frustration associated with current online dating experiences, this research aims to address these challenges by developing a predictive model that leverages both user information and partner feedback. Employing Shapley values for feature importance assessment and DICE for counterfactual analysis, the study identifies key factors such as mutual ’like’ ratings, perceived attractiveness, and shared interests, as significant predictors of match success. The findings suggest that mutual perception plays a more critical role in match formation than objective similarities. Furthermore, the study proposes integrating the model into existing dating platforms to guide users towards more meaningful interactions, thereby enhancing user satisfaction and engagement. This research not only contributes to the understanding of online dating dynamics but also offers practical implications for improving matchmaking algorithms and user experience on dating platforms.
